    "__Important note:__ you'll notice from the documentation that `solve_ivp` has no option to choose the step size `dx`!  Instead, it just takes a tuple `(xi, xf)` defining the solution interval, and the arguments `atol` (absolute tolerance) and `rtol` (relative tolerance) that specify the accuracy we want our solution to have.  The appropriate step size is then calculated from the required error tolerance and the known error formulas for the algorithm used.\n",

    "This is, of course, a much more sophisticated approach than just setting `dx` and hoping for the best as we were doing above!  But working with step size was still a good exercise; even if we can do better for simple one-dimensional ODEs, there are lots of interesting systems (like solving Maxwell's equations) where it's much harder to prove any strict error bound, and we would be back to controlling step size directly.\n",
