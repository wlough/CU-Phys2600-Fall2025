Here is the premise: you're a contestant on a game show, where you have a chance to win a new car.  There are three doors on stage.  One of the doors has the new car behind it; the other two doors have goats.  To win the car, you just have to pick the right door.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest version of this game, it should be obvious that your odds of winning the car are $1/3$.  But let's make the game more interesting!  After you choose a door, the game show host (who knows what is behind all of the doors) opens one of the doors you _didn't_ choose, revealing a goat.  Then the host asks whether you want to keep the door which you selected initially, or switch to the other closed door.  What should you do: keep the door you chose originally, or switch to the other door?\n",

    "The correct answer is summarized at the link above, if you're impatient.  But the theory behind this problem has confused lots of very intelligent people (including famous mathematician Paul Erdos) for decades - so instead of trying to figure it out, let's just use a Monte Carlo simulation to find the answer!\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to make it easier to apply our work to the more complicated full game in the next part, we will use a __modular design__ for our simulation.  This means that we will write several functions, each of which accomplishes one small task required for the full game simulation.  (We'll be able to re-use all of the functions you write in the next part for the more complicated game.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This also lets us use __unit tests__ - we can write individual tests for each of the short functions that you'll be implementing, instead of relying on testing the entire game at once.  Testing the whole game is important too - but unit tests make it much easier to debug small mistakes.\n",

Then run the third cell containing the function `play_monty_hall_simple`, a function that I have written for you which contains the rest of the pieces needed for the simple Monty Hall game.  You can read through that function to see how `shuffle_prizes` and `choose_door_player` are implemented, or rely on the docstrings I've given you."
