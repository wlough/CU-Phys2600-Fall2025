A number of them originate in a region known as the [scattered disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattered_disc), extending from roughly 30 to 100 AU from the Sun (beyond Neptune's orbit.)  These comets can have highly elliptical orbits, which means that they occasionally pass near the Sun and the inner planets.\n",

For each comet, find and record any __close approach__ to any of the eight planets over the next __50 years__ of its orbit, defining a close approach to be passing __within 0.2 AU of any planet__. (This isn't _that_ close: for reference, the Moon is only about 0.003 AU from the Earth.  But it's definitely close enough to be easily observable from the planet being approached.  Events that come really close to a planet are very rare - space is big!)  Clearly indicate __which comet number__ makes a close approach, to __which planet__, and __how close__ it gets.\n",

Don't worry too much if you can't resolve closed orbits for most of the comets using the main loop, some of the orbits are very long!

Using your simulation, find a stable \"orbit\" for an object around Jupiter's L4 or L5 Lagrange point.  Your orbit should be stable over a timescale of 100 years, and the object has to be in motion relative to the Lagrange point.
