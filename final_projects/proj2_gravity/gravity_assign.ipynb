    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The motion of large objects in the solar system is very well understood: Kepler's laws of planetary motion are one of the first applications of the law of gravitation that most physics students see.  However, understanding dynamics under gravity is a very difficult problem in general: even though the motion of _two_ objects can be solved on pen and paper, the \"three-body problem\" (motion of three massive objects under gravity) already has no analytic solutions.  So tracking a single object as it moves through the gravitational field of the solar system is not doable with pen and paper - making it a great candidate for numerical study.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you'll begin by modeling the Sun and the planets of the solar system in their known orbits. Then, you will write a code which can solve for the motion of a small object through the complex gravity field of the Sun and the planets.  (To make things a little less complicated, we will only consider the gravity of Jupiter, the largest planet, in addition to the Sun.)  As one application, you will study the motion of 'Oumuamua - the first interstellar object recorded passing through our solar system.  Then you will consider the paths of comets, looking for which ones will pass close enough to Earth to threaten a collision - and which ones are \"swept up\" by Jupiter before they can reach the inner solar system."

The problem is that for orbits with a high eccentricity, a very small fraction of the orbital period will be spent in the part of the orbit near the Sun, where the acceleration is largest.  We need a small time-step to deal with this close region, but that means we'll need a _lot_ of time steps to get through the entire orbit!\n",
