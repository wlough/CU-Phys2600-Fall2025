    "Cosmic ray muons are a nuisance if you're trying to do a very sensitive search for rare particles, like hunting for dark matter.  To shield against these muons, most dark matter detectors are placed deep underground.  When traveling through the solid rock that makes up the Earth's crust, muons suffer energy losses [as described in section 30.4.1 of this document](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2017/reviews/rpp2017-rev-cosmic-rays.pdf) (don't worry about understanding the rest of the document!)  Implement energy loss for muons passing below $y=0$ in your Monte Carlo simulation.  How far underground would a detector have to be for the muon detection rate (in your model) to pass below 1 muon per year?"
