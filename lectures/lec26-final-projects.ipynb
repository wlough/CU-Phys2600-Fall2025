    "    - There will be __three choices__ for your final project, described next.  \n",
    "    - The grading rubric will be: 30% code, 10% API tests __you write__, 10% documentation, 40% answers to physics questions (using your code!), 10% presentation quality.\n",
    "    - __You are allowed to work together__, but only discussing physics and code.  However, __you must submit 100% original work__ - no sharing code or presentations!"

But using it in practice to answer numerical questions can be difficult - numerical mistakes can be bigger than the size of the planets if you're not careful!  There is also a bit more data analysis involved."
